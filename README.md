# E2CF: The Entry-Extensible Cuckoo Filter
The entry-extensible cuckoo filter (E2CF) is an approximate set representation structure, which supports entry-level extension and fast membership query. E2CF utilizes adjacent buckets with sequential physical addresses in a cuckoo filter to extend bucket entries, which avoids many discrete memory accesses in a query. To further make E2CF space and time efficient, we adopt asynchronous extension and fine-grained splitting methods. Experiment results show that compared to existing designs, E2CF reduces the query and insertion time by up to 82% and 28%, respectively.

## How to use?
### Environment
We implement E2CF in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.2 with an Intel 2.60GHz CPU and 64GB RAM, the size of a cache line in the server is 64 bytes, and we configure OpenSSL library environment in the server. 

Install OpenSSL (Please refer to https://www.openssl.org to learn more).

```txt
sudo apt-get install openssl
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
Build and run the example

```txt
make
./test
```


### Configurations
Configurations including false pisitive, item number and dataset path can be costomized in "configuration/config.txt". 

```txt
false positive = 0.02
item number = 100
input file path = input/input100.txt
```
